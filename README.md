# CASCON 2019 OpenShift Workshop

OpenShift is a Kubernetes distribution which comes with additional capabilities for developers and operators to make building and running cloud-native applications easier.

This hands-on workshop will deploy an application onto an OpenShift cluster. Origin Community Distribution (OKD) is the Kubernetes distribution that powers OpenShift. With Minishift version 3.x, participants can use OKD to get some hand-ons experience of OpenShift locally.

We will start from exploring the web console, create a new project and application in this step, and then get into OpenShift Cli to explore some resources of the project, then we will bring in a bit more details about the deployment configurtion, and explore OpenShift Build process. If we have time, we will also cover some of nice features in OpenShift Template.
